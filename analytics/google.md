# Google Analytics

## Bounce Rate

The [official definition](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009409?hl=en):
> A bounce is a single-page session on your site. In Analytics, a bounce is calculated specifically as a session that triggers only a single request to the Analytics server, such as when a user opens a single page on your site and then exits without triggering any other requests to the Analytics server during that session.

The definition changes slightly when measuring events: 
> a single-page session that includes no user interaction on targeted events.

## Non-interaction events

Events can either be interactive or non-interactive. Interactive events affect bounce rate. See note above.
