# Graphs


A *Strongly Connected* graph is one where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component)).

## Hamiltonian Path
A path that visits each vertex exactly once.

## Eulerian Path
A path that visits every edge once, allowing for repeat visits. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path))
